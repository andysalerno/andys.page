Given a state (i.e. the current context, or input text), it scores all possible next actions (i.e. tokens).
Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple to imagine the task of sampling tokens as a state-space exploration problem, where we use a tree data structure to map out the state space and explore it to find high-scoring states.</description></item><item><title>Using Guidance with GPTQ</title><link>https://andys.page/posts/guidance-gptq/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 14:52:01 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/posts/guidance-gptq/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been very enthusiastically playing with guidance, a library from Microsoft that lets you compose prompts for LLMs, and interact with those LLMs programmatically in a very natural way. I plan on using it for my personal projects going forward.
I&amp;rsquo;m excited because this library lets you build prompts the way you think about prompts. No more fussing around with Langchain.
One issue is, I mostly play with GPTQ-quantized models. My current favorite is Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored-GPTQ, very kindly quantized by TheBloke.</description></item><item><title>4.2 Gigabytes, or: How to Draw Anything</title><link>https://andys.page/posts/how-to-draw/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/posts/how-to-draw/</guid><description>In our world, we can do anything that we want to do here.

- Bob Ross, The Joy Of Painting Season 29 Episode 1
Watching a vibrant Seattle sunset the other day, my imagination started running. The otherworldly hue of the sky evoked something from science fiction. The hazy orange-purple was mesmerizing.
I envisioned a massive, alien object hovering over a long-abandoned Seattle, with a burning orange sky, and buildings overgrown as nature reclaimed the city.</description></item><item><title>Bear plus snowflake equals polar bear</title><link>https://andys.page/posts/weird-emojis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 18:08:57 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/posts/weird-emojis/</guid><description>Prelude: e and e Quick, how many bytes make up the following line? No tricks, I promise.
Hello! The correct answer is: 6. Or 7, if you want to be pedantic and include the newline, but let‚Äôs not.
This is simple enough; this page is encoded as UTF-8, which implies 8-bits per ASCII character, or a byte per character.
Let‚Äôs play again. How many bytes make up the following line?</description></item><item><title>üì∑ First time out with the XPro 3</title><link>https://andys.page/posts/xpro3-first-day/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 21:57:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/posts/xpro3-first-day/</guid><description>After a few years of shooting with the X-T20, I&amp;rsquo;ve swapped up to the X-Pro3.
For my first outing with this camera, of course I chose Pike Place Market. It&amp;rsquo;s surely the easiest place in Seattle to be a street photographer. People are comfortable, having fun, and cameras are everywhere.
Click to view I haven&amp;rsquo;t shot around Pike Place Market in a long time; even before the pandemic, I&amp;rsquo;d walked up and down that market so many times that it was starting to become too familiar.</description></item><item><title>Gallery</title><link>https://andys.page/gallery/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 May 2021 21:57:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/gallery/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How to create a Hugo-based markdown blog</title><link>https://andys.page/posts/another-one/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Aug 2020 15:48:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://andys.page/posts/another-one/</guid><description>Step 1: The spark ignites Oooh, look at this cool person&amp;rsquo;s blog post that was posted on Hacker News&amp;hellip; Why don&amp;rsquo;t I have cool, minimal blog like this?
Step 2: Pick your theme Spend two hours browsing minimal Hugo themes until you find one that&amp;rsquo;s simple yet functional.
Step 3: Simplify Why does this &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; theme include google analytics, disqus, and javascript auto day/night theme detection?
