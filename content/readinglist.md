Below is a collection of things I've been reading and enjoying. The heading dates indicate when I read each item, and the date in the title indicates when it was published.

I began curating this list in June 2023, so at the moment it's not very long :)

## June 2023

- **[Bridging the gap between neural networks and functions (Apr 2023)](https://sebinsua.com/bridging-the-gap)**
    - A concise and readable explanation of some neural-network primitives, explained in familiar terms.
- **[Exploring ChatGPT and open-source models on slightly harder tasks (May 2023)](https://github.com/microsoft/guidance/blob/main/notebooks/chatgpt_vs_open_source_on_harder_tasks.ipynb)**
    - A comparison of free LLMs such as LLaMA, and its fine-tuned spinoffs, with the ChatGPT black box in terms of subjective performance. It's already outdated by the availability of newer models like Falcon or MPT, but still an interesting read.
