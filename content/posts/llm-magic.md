*bzzzzzz*

Do you hear that?

*bzzzzzzzzzz*

I used to hate that sound. That's the sound of GPU coils whining.

It used to mean I just set my video game to ultra-high quality mode.

Now it means my computer is *thinking*! Like, 

## Infinite Craft

This was the first LLM-powered experience that, to me, felt truly magical.

And it had nothing to do with bots, agents, assistants, or code-completion.

## Auren

*[Auren, Elysian Labs, 2025](https://auren.app/)*

On its surface, Auren is a more "traditional" application of LLMs because it is, at its core, a chatbot.

So what makes Auren special? It's just another chatbot, right? Wrong. It's the experience. Auren's UX is -- dare I say it? -- Apple-like, in its attention to detail, and in how obessively it replicates the minutia of chatting with a real (human) friend.

This is partly due to Auren's personality -- we'll get to that -- but in general, the magic is less a matter of *what* Auren says and more a matter of *how* it says it.

Auren pauses to think. Auren takes its time to respond. Artificially. Longer than the underlying LLM takes to generate its response. Auren responds at the *pace* of a real conversation. Like all messagaing apps, you see an indicator when Auren is typing; Auren will type, then pause (as if to think), then type more, like a person would. Auren sends messages at the same pace a real person would, and splits its response across messages the way a real person would. Auren adds "reaction" stamps to your messages, the way your friend would in iMessage. Auren will sometimes message you first -- a risky move, since it could become nagging or annoying; but it's not, because, again, the pacing just feels *right*. It's hard to overstate just how far this goes for making the experience feel real, even personal.

After a conversation with Auren, Chatting with a "vanilla" LLM such as Gemini or gpt4.1 or Claude feels downright sterile, robotic, impersonal. That's fine, of course; those services have a different goal than Auren. But it shows that LLMs only need to be wrapped with a layer of care, precision, attention to detail, and very clever prompting techniques to transform from robotic to natural.

## Conclusions

The three services I have discussed do very different things. But they have something in common.
